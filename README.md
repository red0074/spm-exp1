# Project Name

Brief description of your project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get your project up and running on your local machine and provide guidance on how to push files to GitHub.

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your local machine
- GitHub account
- A GitHub repository created for your project

### Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    ```

### Making Changes

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Make the necessary changes to your files.

### Committing Changes

1. Stage the changes:

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

   This stages all changes. If you only want to stage specific files, replace `.` with the file names.

2. Commit the changes:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your commit message here"
    ```

### Pushing Changes to GitHub

1. Push your changes to the GitHub repository:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

   Replace `main` with the name of your branch if it's different.

2. If this is your first time pushing to this repository, you might need to set the upstream branch:

    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

### Verify Changes on GitHub

Visit your GitHub repository in a web browser to verify that your changes have been pushed successfully.
